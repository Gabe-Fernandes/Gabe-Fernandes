### Hi there 👋

🎓 I'm a full stack developer working primarily with the #512BD4 framework with a degree in mathematics.

🎮 My personal coding projects usually take the form of games made with the Unity game engine.

🎹 Outside of tech, I love to play piano, train martial arts, and compete in gaming tournaments for Starcraft 2.

📫 I'm currently looking for work and love collaborating on projects, so don't hesitate to reach out at: gabrielcatanifernandes@gmail.com
